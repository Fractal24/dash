## DaSH IHIWS

You are invited to participate in a data standards hackathon which will take place during the 17th workshop in the “Fred Farr Forum” room.  Thursday, Friday and Saturday Sept 7th-9th 9am-9pm

## Topics:
* Whole Gene HLA and KIR Analysis.  Automated annotation Gene Feature Enumeration.
* HL7-FHIR: Exchanging HLA and KIR NGS results using Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for Clinical Genomics
* Tools for Allele and Haplotype Frequency Analysis of HLA and KIR

All attendees need to be registered for the IHIWS, but no further registration is required. 
Further details:  Please contact Martin Maiers, mmaiers@nmdp.org


## History:
Six Data Standards Hackathons (DaSH events) have been held since Fall 2014. These events are designed for groups of interested people to come together and produce open source software (hack) or decisions that will facilitate the analysis and interchange of HLA and KIR data.
