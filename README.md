Data Standards Hackathon for NGS based typing of HLA &amp; KIR

The goal of the 2015 hackathon is to:
* produce a service that will interpret novel alleles automatically and utilize HML 1.0 to manage novel variations.

Hackathon attendees should be prepared to either code or discuss issues.

<b>The coding will concentrate on:</b>
*	Adapting, enhancing, modifying our pipeline to process IHIWS samples into <br>
(i)	consensus sequences and HLA nomenclature <br>
(ii)	HML 1.0<br>
(iii)	Enumerated Gene Features (http://igdawg.org/enumeration.html) <br>
(iv)	Variant, variant effects, and functional/clinical annotation
*	Validating the HML, possibly using either or both of these options.<br>
(i)	Check/hack existing validation code produced by NMDP.<br>
(ii)	Consume HML from the above processing, and check that everyone ends up with the same result.

<b>The discussion will concentrate on how to deal with Novel Variation.</b><br>
HLA is one of the most medically relevant gene systems in humans. While rare variants are important determinants of disease, common polymorphisms - especially prevalent in HLA - are more important for histocompatibility and donor-recipient matching. Can we build data standards and pipelines that accommodate both?

As the name 'hackathon' implies, the meeting is geared to 'implementers,' and less so to 'talkers' and 'directors.'
