## DaSH 7 Utrecht

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/dash/master/dashihiws.png" alt="DaSH IHIWS" />

To focus activity at this event we have produced a list of topics, and will form teams around some of them, depending on what people want to work on. Each team should produce code collaboratively and have a functional demo at the end of the event.

1. Modeling peptide processing and presentation pathways (NetChop/Chipper, NetMHC), NeoAntigen Prediction, Whole Genome Sequence Analysis
2. HL7-FHIR (HML==> FHIR bundles), FHIR Clinical Genomics, Sync for Genes
3. IHIWS follow up (GFE, ACT, KIR, Whole Gene HLA and KIR Analysis)
4. Analysis of Primate MHC data using 17th IHIWS Informatics tools
5. Haplotype Frequency Curation 

As usual, there will be an informal meal the evening before the meeting. We will eat at De Zwarte Vosch (http://www.dezwartevosch.nl/) on Sunday 12th November. The meeting will take place at ‘In de Ruimte’ (http://www.inderuimte.org/), on Oudegracht 230, Utrecht. As usual, it will be two days of working, Monday 13th and Tuesday 14th, with lunch and dinner provided. The meeting closes at 4pm on Tuesday, with a dinner for those people staying on. This meeting is timed to allow people to move directly to the HL7-FHIR developer days, taking place in Amsterdam, November 15th to 17th. Please contact Michael Wright for more information: mwright@nmdp.org


## DaSH IHIWS

You are invited to participate in a data standards hackathon which will take place during the 17th workshop in the “Fred Farr Forum” room.  Thursday, Friday and Saturday Sept 7th-9th 9am-9pm

## Topics:
* Whole Gene HLA and KIR Analysis.  Automated annotation Gene Feature Enumeration.
* HL7-FHIR: Exchanging HLA and KIR NGS results using Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for Clinical Genomics
* Tools for Allele and Haplotype Frequency Analysis of HLA and KIR

All attendees need to be registered for the IHIWS, but no further registration is required. 
Further details:  Please contact Martin Maiers, mmaiers@nmdp.org


## History:
Six Data Standards Hackathons (DaSH events) have been held since Fall 2014. These events are designed for groups of interested people to come together and produce open source software (hack) or decisions that will facilitate the analysis and interchange of HLA and KIR data.
